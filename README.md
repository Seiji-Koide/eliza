# Eliza
## What is Eliza?
Eliza, or Doctor, program was originally developed by Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT in the period 1964 -1966, so that Eliza imitates the role of Rogerian phsychiatic therapist. Weizenbaum was greatly shocked when he saw his secretary who was trapped by having a conversation with Eliza and asked him to go out of the room as she faced to a real human therapist, even though she knew that Eliza was just a computer program made by Wiezenbaum by seeing Weizenbaum had tacked to make it in several months. His experience on the ridiculous and desperate behavior of ordinary people to the computer that behaves in the manner of human-like actions or responces drove him to re-think the relation between machines and humans, and then he published a book entitiled "_Computer Power and Human Reason_" (1976). 

## What is this program?
Peter Norvig published the Common Lisp version of Eliza on "_Pradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming_" (PAIP for short) (1992).
